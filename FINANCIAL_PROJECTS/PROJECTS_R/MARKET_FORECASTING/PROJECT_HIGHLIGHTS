## Market Forecasting Models

This project analyzes daily stock returns of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) from 2016 to 2024 using various time series forecasting models in both R and Python. The objective is to evaluate and compare different models to identify the most accurate approach for forecasting future returns.

### Objective
To determine which forecasting model provides the most reliable predictions for NVDA stock returns by comparing performance metrics and residual diagnostics.

### Methods
- Stationarity check using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- Forecasting models applied:
  - ARIMA
  - ETS (Exponential Smoothing)
  - Holt-Winters
  - NNETAR (Neural Networks for Time Series)
  - Prophet (Facebook)
- Forecast combination using averaged model predictions
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MPE

### Key Findings
- ETS performed best with the lowest RMSE and MAE
- Holt-Winters showed the weakest performance
- Forecast averaging produced stable but not superior results
- Residual diagnostics revealed remaining autocorrelation, suggesting some model limitations

### Tools Used
- R: forecast, prophet, nnetar, ggplot2, quantmod
- Python: pandas, statsmodels, fbprophet
- Data source: Yahoo Finance
- Git and GitHub for version control
